# Emotion-detection-using-EEG

The primary objective of this project is to improve the 
performance of emotion recognition using brain signals by applying an 
efficient machine learning algorithm with high accuracy that acknowledges 
and classifies human emotions into happy, sad and neutral.<br> 
EEG signals were 
collected by using SKRIP-BSS-4P EEG Simulator and data pre-processing was 
done for the collected EEG signals. Machine learning algorithms are then 
trained on the extracted features to classify the emotional states into 
categories such as happy, sad and neutral. The study compares the 
performance of several popular machine learning algorithms, including 
Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Tree 
Classification and Random Forest (RF), in terms of accuracy, precision, 
recall, and F1-score. The machine learning algorithm with higher accuracy is 
implemented in Raspberry Pi to visualize the emotion detection output.<br>
The following table explains the accuracy achieved for respective machine learning algorithms.<br>
